###  What is wldbg?

Wldbg is a tool that works as a transparent proxy to a wayland server.
It allows you to hijack wayland's connection(s)
and analyze/modify the transmitted data. It can be easily extended
by passes or it can run in interactive gdb-like mode.

### What is pass?

The calling pass is inspired by LLVM passes.
Pass is a plugin that defines two functions - one for incoming
messages from client and the other for messages from server.
It can modify, print or take arbitrary action with the message and
then forward the message to another pass and so on..

### Using passes

Run wldbg with passes is very easy, just type on command-line:

```
  $ wldbg pass1 ARGUMENTS, pass2 ARGUMENTS -- wayland-client
```

pass1 and pass2 are either paths to the .so files of the passes
or names of the passes from the `passes/` directory without the .so extension
(i. e. dump.so ~~> dump)

If you do not know what passes are available, use:

```
  $ wldbg list
```

To get better understanding how it works, there's exapmle pass
in passes/example.c that is also compiled with other passes
in that directory. Run it as follows:

```
  $ wldbg example -- wayland_client
```

### Using interactive mode

To run wldbg in interactive mode, just do:

```
  $ wldbg -i wayland-client
```

If everything goes well, you'll see:

```
  Stopped on the first message
  C: wl_display@1.get_registry(new id wl_registry@2)
  (wldbg)
```

wldbg is now waiting for your input. By typing 'c' or 'continue', the program
will continue in running. Other usefull commands are:

```
'help'                    -- show help message
'help COMMAND'            -- show help to COMMAND
'b' or 'break'            -- stop running on specified messages
    b id 10                   --> stop on messages with id 10
    b re REGEXP               --> stop on any message matching regexp)
'i' or 'info'             -- show information about running state
    i b(reakpoints)           --> info about breakpoints
    i objects                 --> info about objects
    i proc                    --> info about process
'autocmd'                 -- run command after messages of intereset
    autocmd add RE CMD        --> run CMD on every message matching RE
    autocmd add '' i o        --> display info about objects after every message
'h' or 'hide              -- hide specified messages matching REGEXP, e. g.:
    h wl_pointer.*            --> hide everything for/from wl_pointer
    h wl_display@.*done       --> hide done messages from wl_display
'so' or 'showonly'        -- show only messages matching REGEXP
    so wl_display.*done       --> show only wl_display.done event
's' or 'send'             -- send message to client/server (in wire format)
'e' or 'edit'             -- edit message that we stopped at
'q' or 'quit'             -- exit wldbg
```

When wldbg is run with -g (-objinfo) option, it gathers information about objects.
User then can just type:

```
(wldbg) i o ID
```

where ID is the id of object of interest and wldbg will dump information
it gathered about it. NOTE: this is new and uncomplete feature and at this
moment wldbg gathers information about xdg_surface, wl_surface and wl_buffer objects.

Ctrl-C interrupts the program and prompts user for input.

### Using server mode

Wldbg can run is server mode in which every new connection is redirected to wldbg and
already then to compositor. Upon first connection the user is prompted for an action, every other connection
is connected automatically without stopping. Server mode is also interactive, so everythin that works
in interactive mode, works in the server mode too. To start wldbg in the server mode, use -s switch:

```
$ wldbg -s
Listening for incoming connections...
```

when client connects, you'll see something like:

```
Stopped on the first message
[weston-terminal: 7874] C: wl_display@1.get_registry(new id wl_registry@2)
```

After another client is connected, the messages from both are just interleaved:

```
[weston-terminal: 7874] S: wl_pointer@3.motion(2739198098, 197.000000, 142.000000)
[weston-terminal: 7874] S: wl_pointer@3.frame()
[weston-dnd     : 7930] S: wl_buffer@38.release()
[weston-dnd     : 7930] S: wl_pointer@3.leave(166, wl_surface@14)
[weston-dnd     : 7930] S: wl_pointer@3.frame()
[weston-terminal: 7874] C: wl_surface@10.attach(wl_buffer@17, 0, 0)
[weston-terminal: 7874] C: wl_surface@10.damage(0, 0, 9, 16)
[weston-terminal: 7874] C: wl_surface@10.commit()
```

Server mode is handy for example for debugging interaction of two clients,
like two weston-dnd instances, dragging and dropping between them.

----------------------

Wldbg is under hard (and slow :) developement and not all features are working yet
(those described above should mostly work, though)
